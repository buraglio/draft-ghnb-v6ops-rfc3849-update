--- abstract

The document describes the reservation of an additional IPv6 address prefix
for use in documentation. The reservation of a /20 prefix allows documented
examples to reflect a broader range of realistic current deployment
scenarios.

# Introduction

{{RFC3849}} introduced 2001:db8::/32, describing the use of the IPv6 address
prefix 2001:DB8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation. The
rationale for this reservation was to reduce the likelihood of conflict and
confusion when relating documented examples to deployed systems.

As the global deployment of IPv6 expands and evolves, individual IPv6
network deployment scenarios have also increased is size and diversity, and
there is a requirement for documentation to reflect this increased diversity
and scope. The original 2001:DB8::/32 reservation is inadequate to describe
many realistic current deployment scenarios.

Without this additional address allocation, documentation address prefixes
are drawn from address blocks already allocated or assigned to existing
organizations or to well known ISPs, or drawn from the currently unallocated
address pool. Such use conflicts with existing or future allocations or
assignments of IPv6 address space. The reservation of a further /20 IPv6
address prefix from the Global Unicast Address pool {{RFC4291}} for
documentation purposes avoids such conflicts.

# Current Assignment and Allocation Data

According to the allocation and assignment data published by the Regional
Internet Registries,
{{NROStatsReport}},
in August 2023 some 25.9% of all 62,770 recorded IPv6 unicast allocations and
assignments are larger than a /32 in size. The most common allocation or
assignment size is a /29, used in 24.8% of cases.

The four largest assignments made to end users have been /19s, but these
allocations were made before the RIRs' address allocation policies moved
away from the use of a fixed /48 site address prefix IPv6 address assignment
policies, and in the foreseeable future its unlikely that individual
networks require more than a /20. It is believed that a reservation of a /20
would cover the documentation needs as they relate the broad range of
realistic network deployments.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Security Considerations

IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
infrastructure security.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is to record the reservation of TBD::/20 in the IANA IPv6
{{IANAIPv6SPAR}}. The Source, Destination, Forwardable,
Globally Reachable and Reserved-by-Protocol fields should be recorded as
False. There is no Termination Date for this entry.
The name of the reservation is â€œDocumentation".
