                 Expanding the IPv6 Documentation Space
                   draft-ietf-v6ops-rfc3849-update-02

Abstract

   The document describes the reservation of an additional IPv6 address
   prefix for use in documentation.  The reservation of a /20 prefix
   allows documented examples to reflect a broader range of realistic
   current deployment scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC3849] introduced 2001:db8::/32, describing the use of the IPv6
   address prefix 2001:DB8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in
   documentation.  The rationale for this reservation was to reduce the
   likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating documented
   examples to deployed systems.

   As the global deployment of IPv6 expands and evolves, individual IPv6
   network deployment scenarios have also increased is size and
   diversity, and there is a requirement for documentation to reflect
   this increased diversity and scope.  The original 2001:DB8::/32
   reservation is inadequate to describe many realistic current
   deployment scenarios.

   Without this additional address allocation, documentation address
   prefixes are drawn from address blocks already allocated or assigned
   to existing organizations or to well known ISPs, or drawn from the
   currently unallocated address pool.  Such use conflicts with existing
   or future allocations or assignments of IPv6 address space.  The
   reservation of a further /20 IPv6 address prefix from the Global
   Unicast Address pool [RFC4291] for documentation purposes avoids such
   conflicts.

2.  Current Assignment and Allocation Data

   According to the allocation and assignment data published by the
   Regional Internet Registries, [NROStatsReport], in August 2023 some
   25.9% of all 62,770 recorded IPv6 unicast allocations and assignments
   are larger than a /32 in size.  The most common allocation or
   assignment size is a /29, used in 24.8% of cases.

   The four largest assignments made to end users have been /19s, but
   these allocations were made before the RIRs' address allocation
   policies moved away from the use of a fixed /48 site address prefix
   IPv6 address assignment policies, and in the foreseeable future its
   unlikely that individual networks require more than a /20.  It is
   believed that a reservation of a /20 would cover the documentation
   needs as they relate the broad range of realistic network
   deployments.

3.  Filtering and appropriate use

   Documentation prefixes are for the use or relaying configuration and
   documentation examples and as such MUST NOT be used for actual
   traffic, MUST NOT be globally advertised, and SHOULD NOT be used
   internally for routed production traffic or other connectivity.
   Documentation prefixes should be considered bogon and filtered in
   routing advertisements as appropriate.

4.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

5.  Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the reservation of TBD::/20 in the IANA IPv6
   [IANAIPv6SPAR].  The Source, Destination, Forwardable, Globally
   Reachable and Reserved-by-Protocol fields should be recorded as
   False.  There is no Termination Date for this entry.  The name of the
   reservation is â€œDocumentation".
